# Factor Finder

## Description 

A factor is a number or algebraic expression that equally divides another number or expression, leaving no remainder.

This program finds the factors of a number.

## How it Works

Divide a positive number, n, by the natural numbers 1 to 'n' (using the `range()` function), if it leaves a remainder of 0, it's a factor.

## Program Input & Output

```

Factors of 26 are:
[1, 2, 13, 26]
